# Pokemon Fight Game in the Terminal

- This is a simple terminal-playable Pokemon game with JavaScript basics. I completed the project by extending the original mission requirements to make it more interactive and fun.The game involves two players choosing a trainer each and taking turns to make moves to try to defeat each other's Pokemon. Players select their moves hitting key combinations, and the results are displayed on the screen.
